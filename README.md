# üöÄ webMethods.io Integration DevOps Framework ‚Äî Extended

This document extends the [original automation framework for webMethods.io Integration](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/integration/viewdocument/devops-for-webmethodsio-integratio?CommunityKey=82b75916-ed06-4a13-8eb6-0190da9f1bfa&tab=librarydocuments), highlighting new capabilities such as Integration API support, multi-asset promotion, integrated code review, and secret vault support. The framework is designed with GitHub repositories and Azure DevOps pipelines but can be adapted to other platforms.

## üìå What's New

- ‚úÖ **API (Integration) Support**  
  Automate API (integrations) promotion, alongside workflows, flowservices.

- ‚úÖ **Multi-Asset Promotion Support**  
  Promote multiple assets (APIs, workflows, flowservices, reference data, projectParameters) together in a single release cycle. (Complete Project support has been there from begining)

- ‚úÖ **Integrated Code Review Process**  
  Added "code review" as a qulaity gate using ISCCR (Licensed) for flow services. [code review blog](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/viewdocument/cloud-native-isccr-continuous-cod?CommunityKey=82b75916-ed06-4a13-8eb6-0190da9f1bfa&tab=librarydocuments)

- ‚úÖ **Account/Connection Promotion Support**  
  Added support for automating Account promotion with separating metadata and credentials (Valut) and also separate config per stage.

- ‚úÖ **Secret Vault Integration**  
  Sensitive credentials (tokens, client secrets, credentials) for account/connectuins can stored in Azure Key Vault or GitHub secrets and auto-injected during deployments.

- ‚úÖ **Simplified Configuration Management**  
  YAML-based project configurations track accounts, secrets, and environment-specific metadata.

## üìà Framework Overview

1. **Export & Version Control**
   - Assets are exported from webMethods.io using APIs.
   - Secrets are extracted, masked, and stored separately.
   - Code and metadata are committed to GitHub.

2. **Pull Request & Code Review**
   - Developers raise pull requests for new or updated assets.
   - Code review workflows ensure peer validation before merge. This could also be triggered on PRs (say feature --> codeReview branch)

3. **Promotion & Deployment**
   - Azure DevOps triggers automate import and deployment.
   - Vault secrets are dynamically injected before deployment.
   - Supports batch promotion of multiple assets.

4. **Automated Testing (Optional)**
   - Postman/Newman test collections validate assets post-deployment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Components

| Component        | Role                         |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| Azure DevOps     | CI/CD Pipeline Orchestration |
| GitHub           | Source Control + Code Review |
| Azure Key Vault  | Secret Storage               |
| Postman/Newman   | Automated Testing            |
| webMethods.io    | Target Integration Platform  |

This is a sample setup, but definitely not limited to the above components, framework could be used with other components like, bitbucket, bamboo, gitlab, jenkins etc.

---

## üîê Vault Integration

- Secrets stored securely in:
  - Azure Key Vault (recommended for Azure-hosted projects)
  - GitHub Encrypted Secrets (fallback)

- During import, masked fields are dynamically replaced with actual secrets from vault.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Multi-Asset Promotion Workflow (Individual asset promotion)

- Supports selecting and promoting multiple assets together:
  - APIs
  - workflows
  - flowservices
  - Reference Data
  - Project parametets

---

## üìä Code Review Enforcement

- Feature branch-based development.
- Pull Requests mandatory before merging to DEV/QA/PROD branches.
- Peer reviews using GitHub workflows.
- Secrets never committed in clear text.

---

## üìä Example Pipelines

| Stage            | Trigger            | Outcome                         |
|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Initialize**   | Manual             | New project + repo setup        |
| **Synchronize**  | Manual             | Export + Commit assets          |
| **Promote to DEV**| PR to DEV         | Import assets, inject secrets   |
| **Promote to QA** | PR to QA          | Batch deploy + automated tests  |
| **Promote to PROD**| Manual Approval  | Deploy to production            |
